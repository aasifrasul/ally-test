System Design: Netflix (Frontend Engineer Perspective)
1. . Scope & Requirements Gathering (2–3 min)
    Platforms: Web, Mobile Web, Smart TVs.
    Core features:
    Video Player (adaptive streaming, subtitles, controls)
    Discovery/Feed UI (browsing, search, recommendations)
    Search
    User Profiles (watchlist, preferences, multiple accounts)
    Cross-device Sync (resume watching, state sync)
    Constraints: Low latency, offline support (mobile), accessibility compliance, scale to millions.
2. High-Level Frontend Architecture
    Framework choice: React (SPA + micro-frontends for modularity).
    State Management: Redux/RTK Query or Recoil — for user data (profiles, watchlists, playback state).
    Data Layer: GraphQL/REST API clients with caching (Apollo/React Query).
    Delivery: CDN for assets & metadata, edge nodes for prefetching posters/thumbnails, video segments.
    Rendering: Hybrid CSR + SSR (server-side rendering for SEO & initial load).
3. Deep Dive: Video Streaming Frontend
    Foundation: <video> element + Media Source Extensions (MSE) for adaptive streaming.
    Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):
    Maintain multiple quality levels (240p → 4K).
    Monitor network + buffer → seamless switching at segment boundaries.
    Buffering Strategy:
    Critical buffer (5–10s) → no stalls.
    Target buffer (30–60s) → smooth playback.
    Intelligent prefetch → preload next episode segments.
    Controls & UI:
    Custom controls: scrubber with thumbnails, subtitles toggle, quality override, PiP.
    Accessibility: WCAG compliance, screen reader support, captions styling.
    Error Handling: graceful fallbacks → lower quality, retry segments, multi-CDN failover.
    Cross-Platform: Touch-friendly UI, TV remote support, mobile data-saver modes.
4. Performance Optimization
    Code Splitting: Separate bundles for player, browsing, profiles.
    Lazy Loading: Thumbnails, player scripts only when needed.
    Virtualization: Infinite scroll for carousels (react-window).
    Caching:
    Metadata (IndexedDB / localStorage).
    Service Worker → offline watchlists, resume playback.
    Monitoring: RUM (Real User Monitoring) for startup latency, buffering rates, error tracking.
5. State Management at Scale
    Global Store: user session, preferences, watchlist.
    Ephemeral State: current playback time, buffering, UI overlays.
    Cross-Device Sync: WebSockets / SSE → real-time watch progress.
    Offline → Online Sync: reconcile local changes when network restores.
6. Mobile & Cross-Platform Considerations
    Responsive UI: Adaptive layouts for phone → tablet → TV.
    Battery/Data Saver: Lower default quality on mobile, option to download offline.
    PWAs: Home screen install, offline metadata, push notifications.
    Smart TVs: Larger hit targets, minimal text, remote navigation.
7. Trade-offs & Design Decisions
    SSR vs CSR: SSR for discovery pages, CSR for player.
    Monolith vs Micro-frontend: Micro-frontends allow independent deploys of player, search, profiles.
    Client vs Server State: Recommendations server-driven; playback state client-heavy.
    Caching Levels: CDN edge caching vs local browser caching.
8. Testing & Evolution
    Unit & Component Tests: React Testing Library/Jest.
    E2E: Playwright/Cypress for critical flows (playback, profile switching).
    Performance Testing: Lighthouse, WebPageTest for bundle size and startup latency.
    A/B Testing: Experiment with UI layouts & buffering strategies.
    Scalability: Add new codecs (AV1, HEVC), features (interactive episodes), devices (VR/AR)
